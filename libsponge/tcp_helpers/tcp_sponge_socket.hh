//! \class TCPSpongeSocket
//! This class involves the simultaneous operation of two threads.
//!
//! One, the "owner" or foreground thread, interacts with this class in much the
//! same way as one would interact with a TCPSocket: it connects or listens, writes to
//! and reads from a reliable data stream, etc. Only the owner thread calls public
//! methods of this class.
//!
//! The other, the "TCPConnection" thread, takes care of the back-end tasks that the kernel would
//! perform for a TCPSocket: reading and parsing datagrams from the wire, filtering out
//! segments unrelated to the connection, etc.
//!
//! There are a few notable differences between the TCPSpongeSocket and TCPSocket interfaces:
//!
//! - a TCPSpongeSocket can only accept a single connection
//! - listen_and_accept() is a blocking function call that acts as both [listen(2)](\ref man2::listen)
//!   and [accept(2)](\ref man2::accept)
//! - if TCPSpongeSocket is destructed while a TCP connection is open, the connection is
//!   immediately terminated with a RST (call `wait_until_closed` to avoid this)

//! Helper class that makes a TCPOverIPv4SpongeSocket behave more like a (kernel) TCPSocket
