//! \brief Summary of a TCPConnection's internal state
//!
//! Most TCP implementations have a global per-connection state
//! machine, as described in the [TCP](\ref rfc::rfc793)
//! specification. Sponge is a bit different: we have factored the
//! connection into two independent parts (the sender and the
//! receiver). The TCPSender and TCPReceiver maintain their interval
//! state variables independently (e.g. next_seqno, number of bytes in
//! flight, or whether each stream has ended). There is no notion of a
//! discrete state machine or much overarching state outside the
//! sender and receiver. To test that Sponge follows the TCP spec, we
//! use this class to compare the "official" states with Sponge's
//! sender/receiver states and two variables that belong to the
//! overarching TCPConnection object.
